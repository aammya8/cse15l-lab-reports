## Lab Report 2: Debugging 💣💥❌🦟🪳🐜🦟🪳🐜❌💥💣 
*Debugging the markdown-parse program.*   

*For each change described below, you will find a link to the test-file for a failure-inducing input that prompted the cahnge, a screenshot of the terminal output of running the file demonstrating the symptom of the failure-inducing input, and a screenshot of the the GitHub commit (showing the changes made).*

**CHANGE #1**

*Description of bug,symptom, and improvement*:    
The first test file to cause a failure-inducing input was [test-file2.md](https://github.com/doraemon127/markdown-parse/blob/main/test-file2.md). In the getLinks method in MarkdownParse.java, a print statement to print  currentIndex was added at the end of the while loop. As seen in the image below, running the program on test-file2.md led to an infinte loop.
