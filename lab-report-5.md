## Lab Report 5
*For this lab report, choose any two tests from the 652 commonmark-spec tests where your implementation (or a representative implementation from your group) had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9. Note that this is the implementation in the markdown-parse repository, not the one you did today in lab 10. The tests with different answers should correspond to different bugs – that is, you couldn’t easily fix both with one code change*
