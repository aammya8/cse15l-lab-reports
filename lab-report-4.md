## Lab Report 4
*For each snippet of code, add a test to both your implementation of markdown-parse and the implementation you reviewed. Run the tests and show the results of running the tests on each. This means you should add a total of 6 test methods (3 to each implementation).*    

*For each snippet below, you will find a description of the expected output, the code for the test, and the output for running the test on both implementation. There will then be a short explaination of if/how errors with tests for the 3 snippets can be fixed with a small change*  

*Note, to get the expected output, I uploaded the snippets to GitHub as markdown file. I then saw which was links since they were colored blue in the preview. I then figured out what the link inside should be by clicking the blue links. e.g. I put the snippet files into a repo called `random`. Then when I clicked a link it redirected to `https://github.com/doraemon127/random/blob/main/ucsd.edu`, telling me that the read link was `ucsd.edu`*

**SNIPPET 1**

Expected Output: ```[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]```       
 

Code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for JUnit Test:   
```
    @Test
    public void testSnippet1() throws IOException, NoSuchFileException {
        Path fileName = Path.of("snippet1.md");
        String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        ArrayList<String> actual_result = MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents);
        List<String> expected_result = new ArrayList<>();
        expected_result.add("`google.com");
        expected_result.add("google.com");
        expected_result.add("ucsd.edu");
        assertEquals(expected_result, actual_result);
    }
```

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):   
```   
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]> but was:<[url.com, `google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]>   
```

```   
 

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change:

**SNIPPET 2**

Expected Output: `[a.com, a.com(()), example.com]`       
 

Code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for JUnit Test:   
```   
    @Test
    public void testSnippet2() throws IOException, NoSuchFileException {
        Path fileName = Path.of("snippet2.md");
        String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        ArrayList<String> actual_result = MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents);
        List<String> expected_result = new ArrayList<>();
        expected_result.add("a.com");
        expected_result.add("a.com(())");
        expected_result.add("example.com");
        assertEquals(expected_result, actual_result);
    }
