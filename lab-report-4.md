## Lab Report 4
*For each snippet of code, add a test to both your implementation of markdown-parse and the implementation you reviewed. Run the tests and show the results of running the tests on each. This means you should add a total of 6 test methods (3 to each implementation).*   

*For each snippet below, you will find a description of the expected output, the code for the test, and the output for running the test on both implementation. There will then be a short explaination of if/how errors with tests for the 3 snippets can be fixed with a small change*

**SNIPPET 1**

Expected Output:      
 

Code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for JUnit Test:      
 

Output of running test on MY implementation:      
 

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):      
 

Output of running test on REVIEWED implementation:      
 

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):      
 

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change:

**SNIPPET 2**

Expected Output:      
 

Code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for JUnit Test:      
 

Output of running test on MY implementation:      
 

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):      
 

Output of running test on REVIEWED implementation:      
 

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):      
 

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change:

**SNIPPET 3**

Expected Output:      
 

Code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for JUnit Test:      
 

Output of running test on MY implementation:      
 

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):      
 

Output of running test on REVIEWED implementation:      
 

Specific part of JUnit output that shows test failure (if applicable):      
 

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change:
