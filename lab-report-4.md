## Lab Report 4
*For each snippet of code, add a test to both your implementation of markdown-parse and the implementation you reviewed. Run the tests and show the results of running the tests on each. This means you should add a total of 6 test methods (3 to each implementation).*   

*For each snippet below, you will find a description of the expected output, the code for the test, and the output for running the test on both implementation. There will then be a short explaination of if/how errors with tests for the 3 snippets can be fixed with a small change*
