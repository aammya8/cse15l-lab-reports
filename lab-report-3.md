There are a few different syntax to use the `scp -r` command.  To copy over everything in your local directory (not just all the files you see with `ls' but all the files in `.git' as well), use the following syntax, with your CSE15L account username in place of USERNAME, and the name of the directory you want to copy in place of DIRECTORY_NAME:      
 

`scp -r . USERNAME@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/DIRECTORY_NAME`
